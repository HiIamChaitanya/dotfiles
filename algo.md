# Stow inplementation 
dotfiles are implemented via GNU stow and the general implem. are done via sequential methods which implements the algorthm in the format of the script ans system precesses. done in container the is by part approach and the coreahernce is the standart infrence method which listes to the main channel and the program is the standard approach.
which later converts to the by part approach.
the standard methods are the general methods and the end term is not the onle sequence whcih leads to the main sequence and the changes which later transends to the sub processes.

## **Shell**

the standard shell is the main host to the processes and the data feads via shell valitation.

---

the data part 

most concorence are implemented in the enable processes and the main refrence in the time complex processes.

---  

gains are computed via variable and concatanation methods which are crutial to the implementation.
