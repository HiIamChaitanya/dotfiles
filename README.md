## Dotfiles for Fedora Workstation

### Install

```
curl \-Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HiIamChaitanya/dotfiles/main/setup.sh | sh
```

### TO-DOs

- automate setup for my workstation cluster (laptop and workstation) for shared instance that includes shared resources
- use gnome delta project 

### Functionality 

These are my core "dotfiles," used to customize a fresh installation of **Fedora Workstation** for my development workflow and general setup. The setup.sh script automates the install of dotfiles on new install not installing dotfiles of my preferred environment. Key areas include:

* Shell configuration (Fish, starship, tmux)  
* Editor settings (e.g., NeoVim)  
* System-wide preferences  
* and other common software & tools install  
* Whitesure GTK theme packs for gnome  
* adding colorscript  
* setup work env and dev tools  
* install KiCad & FreeCad config  
* installing my own terminal tools for monitoring home lab (private \- only on local network)

### **üìù Note**

These dotfiles & script are specifically written and tested for Fedora Workstation.
